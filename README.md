# Pacbio_nucleosome_mapping_demo

This demo is for nucleosome mapping on Pacbio seq reads. Bioinformatics and curve fitting tool boxes are required.

You can start by running the met_data_analysis_pip.m which will sequentially align reads, generate matrix, calculate NDR length, and generate nucleosome positioning heatmaps.The input file is the example.fastq file in ccs folder. Reference sequences are in ref folder.
